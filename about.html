     <p class="p1">
     Hello, I am Etol, a live coder based in Venice, Italy. <br>
     I discovered the practice of live coding in 2015 when I saw a performance by Andrew Sorensen and, through his advice, <br>
     I downloaded Sonic Pi and started my journey of learning and experimenting with code and music.<br>
     I perform regularly at gigs and streaming events and I am part of a live coding duo named <a class="lin" href="https://ctrl-lashtal.bandcamp.com/releases"> Ctrl-LaShTal </a> <br> alongside a fellow live coder named Emme.<br>
     In February 2020 I have performed alongside Sam Aron @Algorave Prato. <br>
     My major interest at the moment is exploring the intricate musical results generated by a simple one-line command using TidalCycles,<br>
     hence my style has been described as "minimalistic", which is something I am very proud of :)
