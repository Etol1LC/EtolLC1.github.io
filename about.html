     Hello, I am Claudio Etol, a live coder based in Venice Italy. <br>
     I have discovered the practice of live coding in 2015 when I saw a performance by Andrew Sorensen and, through his advice, <br>
     I downloaded Sonic Pi and started my journey of learning and experimenting with code and music.<br>
     I perform regularly at gigs and streaming event and I am part of a live coding duo named Ctrl-LaShTal.<br>
     In February 2020 I have performed alongside Sam Aron @Algorave Prato. <br>
     My major interest at the moment is exploring the intricate musical results generated by a simple one-line command using TidalCycles, <br>
     hence my style has been described as "minimalistic", which is something I am very proud of :)
    </p>
