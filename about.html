        Hello, I am Etol, a live coder based in Venice, Italy. <br>
        I discovered the practice of live coding in 2015 when I saw a performance by Andrew Sorensen and, through his advice, <br>
        I downloaded Sonic Pi and started my journey of learning and experimenting with code and music.<br>
        I perform regularly at gigs and streaming events and I am part of a live coding duo named <a class="lin" href="https://ctrl-lashtal.bandcamp.com/releases"> Ctrl-LaShTal </a> <br> 
        alongside Emme, also a Live Coder, from my hometown.<br>
        In February 2020 I have performed alongside Sam Aron @Algorave Prato. <br>
        My style has been described as "minimalistic", which is something I am very proud of :)<br>
        My first live coding album <a class="lin" href="https://etol.bandcamp.com/releases"> Shell Shock</a> has been released on Bandcamp on the 12th of November 2021.
        It consist of 7 live coding improvisations recorded on a train between Venice and Padua in 2021, with no post-editing performed.
